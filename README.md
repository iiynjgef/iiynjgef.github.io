## üî¨ Research Experience
**Ph.D. research @<a href="https://tnau.ac.in/" target="_blank">TNAU</a> (_2021 - 2023_)**
- Developed and applied advanced tissue culture techniques like embryo culture to rapidly generate **somaclonal variants of rice** with improved salinity stress tolerance.
- Identified and validated novel genomic regions **(QTLs)** governing salinity tolerance through **molecular mapping** in rice F<sub>2</sub> populations along with thorough phenotypic and biochemical characterization.
- Employed **multi-omics approaches** including GC-MS metabolomics to uncover key genes and metabolites linked to superior osmotic/ionic adjustment under salt stress.

**Research scholar @ <a href="https://www.icrisat.org/" target="_blank">ICRISAT</a> (_2018 - 2020_)**
- Single plant phenotying of diverse germplasm accessions (Sorghum, Peral millet, Pigeon pea ‚Äì genotyped 1,980 plants/samples combined) to examine intra and inter accession genetic diversity. 
- Single plant genotyping of accessions using **<a href="https://www.diversityarrays.com/" target="_blank">DArTSeq</a> based SNPs**.
- Harnessed whole genome genotyping, simulations, and predictive modeling to provide integrated insights into the dynamics of genetic variation across a species' range, by quantifying genomic diversity within and between isolated subpopulations, and developed optimized statistical frameworks to guide sustainable sampling regimes that limit genetic drift.
